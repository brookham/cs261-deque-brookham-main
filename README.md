# You Don't Know Deques

But after this, you will.

In this assignment, you will engage in a test-driven development process to implement a deque, a FIFO data structure providing O(1) enqueue and dequeue operations from _either end_ of the double-ended queue. We'll call it a "Deque."

## Run the Test Suite

`python3 -m unittest test_deque`

Open both *test_deque.py* and *deque.py* in your editor of choice. Modify the implementation in *deque.py* to pass the first test. Once it passes, create a commit. Then, uncomment the next test, and re-run the test suite. Implement what's necessary to pass the test, and then repeat this process.

**But wait!**

Toward the middle of the test suite, you should be thinking about the algorithmic efficiency of each operation. Are the enqueue and deque operations all O(1)?

## Best Done in Pairs!

Get together with a friend in front of just one machine, and take turns being the driver. Change drivers after each test is passed. Don't forget to commit after each test.
